# Origin Deities

A Fabric mod adding a layer for deities to the Origins mod. **I will not port this to Forge.**

Originally made for a friend server, a lot of origins in this are built with usage in multiplayer in mind but may work in single-player as well. 

## Layers

The primary layer in this is the **Diety**, each deity has a set of unique (possibly active) powers. The secondary layer is **Aspect** which is shared between multiple deities and have passive powers. 

### These are unbalanced.

Undoubtedly, they are. They exist mostly to encourage different play styles.

## What are these deities?

I made them up for my world building. Though a lot of them are based on real deities to greater or lesser degree.
