# Origin Deities

A Fabric mod adding a layer for deities to the Origins mod. **I will not port this to Forge.**

This mod was originally made for a personal server project and is meant to be used in multiplayer, a lot of origins in this are built with usage in multiplayer in mind but may work in singleplayer as well. 

These are *unlikely* to be balanced.

## What are these deities?

I made them up. Well, majority of them are based on some real deity so, I didn't fully make them up. :shrug:
